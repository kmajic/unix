### Work in progress! ###

Just some common aliases and repositories I use. To add the aliases, execute this from the command line (as root):

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmajic/unix/master/ssh >> /etc/bashrc; source /etc/bashrc

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmajic/unix/master/vim >> /etc/vimrc
