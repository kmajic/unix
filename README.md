### Work in progress! ###

Just some common aliases and repositories I use. To add the aliases, execute this from the command line (as root):

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmajic/unix/master/bash >> /etc/profile; source /etc/profile

echo "colorscheme torte" >> /etc/vimrc; source /etc/vimrc
